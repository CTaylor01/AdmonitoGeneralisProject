# Introduction
A New Digitized Edition of the Admonito Generalis as prepared by Cole Taylor, History Ph.D. Student at Fordham University. This github serves as a repository of the .xml and .odd files necessary for deployment to TEIPublisher as well as the code and files that constructed the .xml edition. As I learn more coding, I plan on having a full display of the text using TEIPublisher embedded within a website which can accurately display the text as intended.

I am grateful for Frances Eshleman, History Ph.D. Student at Fordham, for providing the documentaiton on creating .odd files and the various ways to reconfigure the display of text. I also must give credit to the Siege of Antioch Project Team at Fordham University for teaching me the basic formatting of an .xml file, and I largely follow the code guidelines established by this project to recreate the Admonito Generalis. The python code for calculating Euclidean distance between points comes from 2LT Dylan Taylor, MSECE at Purdue University.
