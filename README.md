# Introduction
This is a new digital edition of the first seven _capitula_ of the Admonito Generalis as prepared by Cole Taylor, a History Ph.D. Student at Fordham University. This GitHub serves as a repository of the .xml and .odd files necessary for deployment to TEIPublisher as well as the code and files that constructed the .xml edition. As I learn more coding, I plan on having a full display of the text using TEIPublisher embedded within a website which can accurately display the text as intended. This project serves as the final assignment for Dr. Brian Reilly's course _Editing Medieval Texts_ at Fordham University. What follows is how to use the files, my research methods, the historical context of the text, and the scholarly tradition of the text. For these subsections, full bibliographic information is provided for corresponding references in the bibliography subsection.

# Using the Files
If you would like a more visual representation of the text, outside of reading .xml code, follow the steps below:
  1. Navigate to https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/tei-publisher/index.html
  2. Log in with the username: "tei-demo" and password: "demo" (Do not include the quotations when signing in)
  3. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and enter a file name and title for display (these can be anything you wish) then click create. You will now see your .odd at the bottom of the long list, click the pencil/pen icon which will take you to the .xml of the .odd.
  4. CTRL+A and delete the text, then copy the text from the style sheet provided by this repo and paste all of it into the file, be sure to click save at the top.
  5. Navigate back to the TEI Publisher tab and click on 'Playground' and click the Upload button on the right, select the Admonito Generalis.xml file to upload
  6. You should now see the edition on the screen, click the title of the edition to access the digital edition.
  7. Click on the three lines to the far right (below where it says logged-in as tei-demo) and under 'select ODD' select the .odd you created and then click out to return to the edition.
  8. You should now have a visual representation of the edition that represents what I will (eventually) have hosted on a website, removing all these steps to access a visual version of the edition.
  9. Do note that the tei-demo account is a **public** account, meaning that other people can view and access the .odd and .xml that you upload as part of these steps. In order to keep the tei-demo account clean, I recommend you remove the uploaded .xml and .odd files after you have finished viewing the text.

The python file provided can also be used to run your own calculations of Euclidean distance, simply change the Matrix and MatrixNames to your preference as well as the matrices themselves with their corresponding points. For example, change V = [0,1,1....] to the corresponding point and sigla, and change the matrix = [V, M3, P3G] to the sigla you use to identify the point. Then, change matrixNames = ['M3', 'V', 'P3G'] to the corresponding sigla. Be sure to keep the apostrophes and commas that define the sigla.
## Research Methods
This edition is first and foremost eclectic and genealogical. My reasons for pursuing this method are twofold. Firstly, given the intense variance present within a text as legalistic as the _Admonito_, I could not logically prefer a Bédier best-text edition. This necessity to emphasize the variation itself derives from my focus on presenting the information contained within the ‘text’ of the _Admonito_. In this case, there is an idea of the 'work', i.e. the abstract _Admonito Generalis_, and the actual text of the 'work', i.e. the manuscript evidence. Secondly, the current standard edition of the _Admonito_ is the _Monumenta Germaniae Historica_'s edition as prepared by Hubert Mordek, Klaus Zechiel-Eckes and Michael Glatthaar, which contains elements that do not translate easily to a clean page along with stylistic representation choices that leads to a 'noisy' text. For example, the current digital _MGH_ edition contains italicization and punctuation elements which are not represented within the manuscripts and instead derive from editorial intervention. As for the apparatus and it's connection to a 'clean' page, within the actual text of the _Admonito_ nearly half of each page is covered by extensive footnotes denoting variants and connections among other information such as references.[^1] Therefore, with my presentation of the text, both of these issues are rectified. I do not present elements within the edition that are themselves not present in the manuscripts, therefore extensive punctuation and italicization are absent from this edition. Furthermore, because of the .xml coding, I can present all the information within the footnotes within the text through tooltips. Therefore, this allows for those who are not wholly interested in the manuscript variation to have a more fluid reading experience while still containing all the information for those who are interested in the variations. This is not to say that there has not been extensive effort on the _MGH_'s part to include new digital tools in the representation of the text. For example, the openMGH project seeks to encode the various editions into TEI .xml documents yet this does not call into question the editorial practices of the _MGH_ but instead presents the information in an alternative format. 

The _MGH_'s edition concerns itself with many more manuscripts than this edition's six manuscripts. In choosing the manuscripts for this edition I had several qualifications. Firstly, the manuscript had to be available digitally. Secondly, based on the stemma constructed by the _MGH_, I decided not to choose any manuscripts which were completely unrepresentative or those which were deemed most accurate thereby affording me a middle slice of information. In selecting the manuscripts, I did not rely on any random selection principle but rather went through the list of manuscripts that pertain to the _Admonito_ and chose them by hand. Of the fifty or so-manuscripts, around fifteen are considered the most extensive and eleven of these fifteen are available digitally. For the remaining thirty-five manuscripts, they range from merely a table of contents to significant portions of the text although they vary wildly in which _capitula_ they cover. Thirdly, the manuscripts each had to start in the same place. In practice, this means the manuscripts had to begin with _capitulum_ one and continue for enough length to satisfy the word count requirements of the final project. The reason so many manuscripts and fragments exist for this text will be explored in the Historical Context section. For the future, I do wish to expand this project beyond the confines of a final assignment, and in turn include more manuscripts, yet this test project still laid the groundwork in terms of structure and method. 

The earlier discussion of 'work' and 'text' deserves further clarification as it pertains to this edition. A guiding principle behind the construction of this edition was the separation between work and text. My approach to texts therefore is necessarily informed by a Tansellian framework that establishes texts as artifacts.[^2] It is my aim to present the information within the manuscripts in a detailed, readable, and usable manner while minimizing my role as editor given the lack of punctuation and other forms of intervening representations. This approach is implicitly informed by Michel Foucault's approach to authorship and works, "A theory of the work does not exist, and the empirical task of those who naively undertake the editing of works often suffers in the absence of such a theory."[^3] Therefore, my main editorial approach is that I am editing artifacts, texts, and conveying the representation of what the manuscript evidence claims to be. I am in no way editing the 'work' of the _Admonito_, and thus the pitfalls highlighted by Foucault are inapplicable to this project. 

Regarding my edition itself, I have referred to it as both eclectic and genealogical. Translating this to actual editing is as follows: I do not rely on one single manuscript as the 'base' manuscript to reconstruct the text and I have relied on the stemma tree as the main indicator for which word or variant is more representative of a lost original text. For those of you who are interested, you can click on this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BfXLSrxTd5cx6P3301I7lhqfgmOPAVCdPUK93fDy8LE/edit?usp=sharing to see the actual process of how I constructed the stemma tree, with the sheets at the bottom corresponding to the order of operations. Firstly, I began with transcribing the text of the manuscripts from left to right, beginning with Munich, Clm. 14468 and ending with Paris, Lat. 10758. To streamline the tracking of variations, I color-coded the instances of variations based on their type. For example, misspellings received a light blue whereas word variations received a light yellow, and when omissions occurred, I darkened the corresponding boxes and finally when scribes switched words these variations received a light green. With the manuscripts fully transcribed, I then began on recension. For most instances, depending on the variations and their proximity, the variations either received a 1 or 0 depending on whether they possessed a specific variation. It is important to note that I drew no distinction between genealogically relevant and genealogically irrelevant information, therefore misspellings were counted as genealogically relevant variations in contrast to Schøsler's conceptions.[^4] In other cases, I combined variations together that were similar enough, i.e. they only varied in one letter. Finally, after each manuscript received a one or zero for its variations, I calculated the distance between these manuscripts. The string of 1's and 0's correspond to the manuscript's vector in an abstract literary space and to calculate the distance between manuscripts, I relied on Euclidean distance. While it would be interesting to see how the stemma tree would have been constructed had I chosen a different distance formula, the Euclidean distance is the simplest and most straight forward for our purposes here. From here, according to the distance, I paired the closest manuscripts together in which the first pairing was P1 and P2, followed by M1 and M2, then P(1+2) and G, and finally P(1+2)G with V. In combining the manuscripts for the purposes of subsequent rounds of distance calculation, I found the average points between the two manuscripts. For example, if P1 had a variation but P2 did not, then the corresponding number for the combined manuscript would be 0.5. This entire process led to the creation of the stemma tree shown here:

![alt text](https://github.com/CTaylor01/TheAdmonitoGeneralisProject/blob/main/Stemma%20Tree.png?raw=true)

Finally, it was time to reconstruct the manuscript evidence. Using the stenna tree, I went through word by word choosing the word that is most the 'average' or representative of the lost original according to its place on the tree. Starting with one at the omega symbol, I divided by two for each branch of the stemma tree which formed the likelihood that the specific word was the most representative. This formed the lemma of the text or the base representation of the text, with the variations which were found not to be the 'right' fit, I encoded them as readings of the lemma. Therefore, there is a usable and visual text that readers can interact with, but if they want more information on why a particular word was chosen over others, they can hover over the red words to show variations. What is left then at the end is a relatively clean text in which all the manuscript evidence is encoded into the text itself. 

With the process established, it is ever prudent to turn towards disparities between digital and traditional editions and their defining characteristics. While I largely contrast this edition with the _MGH_'s, it is worth noting that the current edition of the _Admonito_ is available digitally through the _MGH_. But there are several extant issues with denoting an edition as 'digital' and one as 'traditional' which largely rests on how a person defines the two. For the digital editions, one could define them simply as whether they are available online. Taking this definition and applying it to the _MGH_ holds true, it is in fact a digital edition of the _Admonito_. This is directly involving the current 'standard', or at least what the _MGH_ considers to be the official, and in no way referencing the work of the openMGH project. Yet this definition leaves several unresolved issues, namely that there exists little user interaction, outside of a search function, within the page and that the digital edition is itself an interactable photo of the page as it appears in the print copy and presented online. Therefore, this matter of definitions cannot be resolved so easily. If we change the definition of a digital edition to say that it must include x or y element, then we necessarily engage in exclusionary scholarship which seeks more to discredit than collaborate. One possible solution to this conundrum is to instead present the nature of digital editions on a scale rather than as binaries. Therefore, we can comfortably place the _MGH_ edition on the more conservative side of the scale regarding the possibilities of digital editions and then place this current edition more so towards the exploratory side of technology. I am by no means the first person to present this issue of digital and traditional editions, as Appolon and Bélisle present the "explosion" of traditional editorial scholarship in the wake of the digital edition.[^5] While this process of digitization will undoubtedly uproot some, if not most, of the longstanding pillars of editorial and textual scholarship, it also opens up a plethora of pathways that can only add to the relationship between text, editor, author, and reader.

# Historical Context
The first question that comes to mind when considering the amount of manuscript witnesses, especially for an early medieval source, is why were there so many to begin with? While an obvious answer would be that it was a series of _capitula_ issued by Charlemagne and therefore people across the empire copied it down, yet this does not capture the complex reality of the extensive presence of this text. To answer the question, we must first establish what the _Admonito_ is and the context for its creation and then we can explore the reason why so many manuscripts exist for this text. 

The _Admonito Generalis_ is primarily concerned with the correction of texts and rectifying corrupted texts. The Latin used for liturgical service was of chief concern, as the center of the reform laid on ensuring that the laity could achieve eternal salvation, and the only way to achieve this was to pray in correct Latin. Therefore, given the sheer importance of this text in the Carolingian mindset, for Marco Mostert, it is shocking that even some scribal variation was allowed as shown through the surviving manuscripts.[^6] However important the saving of souls was, the chief interest of the _Admonito_ lay in the textual transmission of the faith.

Why was reform necessary? While this question is impossibly large, we can perhaps whittle it down by looking at its constiuent parts of what the Carolingians were reforming and how they sought to achieve a 'reformed' society. The Carolingians sought to correct the texts of the Christian faith and because of this correction people's behavior and the possibilities of achieving salvation would improve. While the contours of Carolingian society that are deemed worthy of correcting are relatively scant within the _Admonito_ in terms of local realities, a different text or rather collection of texts can help paint a more illustrious picture of improper behavior. Namely, the _Capitula Episcoporum_ offers tremendous insight into the specific behaviors that would be rectified through correct teaching using correct books. According to some scholars, such as Carine van Rhijn, the _Capitula Episcoporum_ should be considered as part of this reform movement which centers on specific instances of the conceptualization of reform and the application of the _Admonito_’s terms to the respective dioceses of the bishops.[^7] As far as examples of improper behavior, Theodulf of Orléans laments at the storing of hay and animals within churches within his capitula.[^8] In another case, again from Theodulf, priests should not be roving the village drunk.[^9] Therefore, when the _Capitula Episcoporum_ are placed in conjunction with the _Admonito_, a more complete picture of the current status of Carolingian society emerges, a status which Carolingian elites sought to rectify and correct.

The reason the _Admonito_ has so many extant witnesses relates directly back to the necessity of reform and the nature of the work. Once Charlemagne issued the _Admonito_, it became necessary for the _missi dominici_ or royal agents tasked with overseeing laws and practices in every region of the empire to have a copy of the _Admonito_ so they knew exactly what the eventual emperor desired.[^10] Therefore, scribes created a large amount of manuscripts in a relatively short amount of time to serve the _missi_ as they traveled across the extensive empire and to correct the books used for prayer and education.[^11] While only a fraction of full manuscripts survive, the plethora of fragments reveal the large amount of manuscripts that were created. As will be explored, scholars have frequently called the issuing of the _Admonito_ as the beginning or at the very least the codifying of the Carolingian _correctio_ movement.

# Scholarly Tradition
The _Admonito Generalis_ has long served as the great separator for historians, it was the work that set the Carolingians apart from the rest of the early medieval period. This was due in part to the view that the _Admonito_ began the _correctio_ or Carolingian reform movement. This reform movement, which some scholars have called the 'little r' renaissance, has largely served in this separation mechanism. It made the Carolingians unique and worthy of hyper-specialization which relatively recently has been called into question.[^12] In line with this need to be unique, Carolingian scholars have primarily engaged in two avenues of approach towards the _Admonito_. The first, and most common, is reliance on the _MGH_ edition as the authoritative text and primary source for all things Carolingian. This is largely regarding those scholars who prioritize editions as the basis for inquiry and are completely representative of Carolingian writing.[^13] It is worth noting that this is by no means negative, rather it is merely the process of historical scholarship. The second approach largely circumvents the _MGH_ as well as editions altogether and instead focuses on the manuscripts themselves as the basis for primary sources. This second approach permits scholars to engage in more narrow scopes of textual transmission and production as well as handwriting or illumination, among others. Therefore, for the former approach, there have been three areas of Carolingian society that scholars use the _Admonito_ to further elucidate: authority, religion, and education. For the second approach, it is much more varied and diverse, which is impossible to cover entirely, but an attempt will be made. Thus, let us first look at the three areas and how scholars have used this text.

The _Admonito_ implicitly articulates conceptions of imperial power. It was the emperor who dictated how, where, and when these reforms occurred. However, it is important to note that as far as religious authority, Charlemagne deferred to the bishops of his realm to further 'correct' the issues they saw.[^14] Regardless, the _Admonito_ served as one of the key indicators of how 'great' Karolus Magnus was for twentieth century historians as demonstrated by their heightened focus on Charlemagne alone. For modern historians, Charlemagne's authority was more fluid and dynamic than these earlier historians established.[^15] Scholars have frequently pointed to the _Admonito_ as foundational to the conception of Frankish identity. This has led some historians to claim that Carolingian Christianity is better defined as the Frankish Cult, given the sheer amount of aspects of faith that were 'corrected' or in the process of being corrected.[^16] This has also contributed to the notion of specialization, that the Carolingians were doing something unique that warrants continued study for modern historians. As far as education is concerned, John J. Contreni's elaborations are fundamental. For Contreni, the _Admonito_'s influence on education within the Carolingian empire cannot be overstated, as the _Admonito_ directly led to the production of texts which enhanced and spread medieval education.[^17] Given the implication that after the _correctio_ the texts are relatively fixed, then the quality of the education improves alongside this wider access.

With one avenue of approach with respect to the _Admonito_ explored, let us now turn to the practice of manuscript scrutiny. As stated earlier, Carolingian scholars readily accept the _MGH_'s authority as the definition edition of primary sources pertaining to the Carolingian period. However, some scholars such as Marco Mostert readily bypass the edition to reach the manuscripts. Mostert's conclusions, which largely focus on the extreme presence of variations within the _Admonito_, center around literacy. Essentially, the reason so many variations persisted in a text as important as the _Admonito_ is primarily due to the high literacy of the scribes.[^18] Inadvertently, the very process of _correctio_ or correcting itself lended the scribes the authority to correct the text which emphasized their authority in the first place.
