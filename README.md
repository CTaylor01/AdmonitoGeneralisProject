# The Admonito Generalis Project
A New Digitized Edition of the Admonito Generalis as prepared by Cole Taylor, History Ph.D. Student at Fordham University. This github serves as a repository of the .xml and .odd files necessary for TEI Publishing. As I learn more coding, I plan on having a full display of the text using TEI Publisher embedded within a website which can accurately display the text as intended. For now, it is simply the .xml code and marked up documents along with the .odd style guidelines.

I am grateful for Frances Eshleman for providing the documentaiton on creating .odd files and the various ways to reconfigure the display of text. I also must give credit to the Siege of Antioch Project Team at Fordham University for teaching me the basic formatting of an .xml file, and I largely follow the code guidelines established by this project to recreate the Admonito Generalis.
